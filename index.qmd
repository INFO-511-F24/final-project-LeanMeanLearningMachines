## Abstract

This study aims to analyze flight data from major Belgian airports using the `flights.csv` dataset, focusing on identifying patterns and trends in flight departures and arrivals. The primary research question investigates how monthly and yearly flight activities at Brussels Airport compare to those at other airports in Belgium, and whether seasonal trends significantly impact flight volumes. To achieve this, a comprehensive data exploration will be conducted, followed by data preprocessing to ensure consistency and accuracy.

## **Introduction**

This project focus on analyzing the flight data from January 2016 to January 2020 in for major airports in Europe, with a focus on Brussels Airport, one of the largest and busiest in Europe. Specifically, this project investigates how the total number of monthly flight departures and arrivals at Brussels Airport compares to other major airports in Belgium and examines the seasonal trends over the year. Insights from this study could assist airport management in anticipating seasonal changes, optimizing resource allocation, and improving operational efficiency.

#### **Data Description**

This data comes from Eurocontrol, an international organization for air traffic control management throughout Europe. Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) collects information on daily flights arriving and departing European airports ([Commercial air transport in August 2021: in recovery - Products Eurostat News - Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20210914-1)), and we sourced from the GitHub repository associated with the Tidytuesday project ([tidytuesday/data/2022/2022-07-12/readme.md at main · rfordatascience/tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2022/2022-07-12/readme.md)).  This data contains 15 columns and 7306 rows for flights from the 2016 to 2019. The columns contain information such as the date of the flight, airport designator, airport name, country of the airport, and the numbers of departures and arrivals to the airport.  

Key variables we have applied in our research are:

**Quantative Variables:**

-   FLT_DEP_1 - Contains total number of departing flights

-   FLT_ARR_1 - Contains total number of arriving flights

**Categorical Variables:**

-   APT_NAME - Contains airport names

<!-- -->

-   STATE_NAME - Contains name of the country

-   MONTH_MON - Contains the month in which the records of departures and arrivals took place

#### Data **Cleaning and** Preprocessing

To ensure data integrity and analytical clarity, several preprocessing steps were undertaken:

-   Date Conversion: The variable YEAR_MONTH was converted to a date-time format for temporal analysis.

-   Derived Variables: New variables, such as total monthly flights (sum of departures and arrivals), were created to facilitate trend analysis.

-   Handling Missing Values: Observations with incomplete data for key variables were excluded.

-   Grouping and Aggregation: Data was aggregated by airport and month to examine trends and seasonal patterns.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis

As is shown in Fig. 1 below, Brussels Airport consistently showed the highest flight activity, highlighting its dominant role in Belgian air traffic. The chart also exhibits clear seasonal peaks during the summer and declines in winter.

Fig.2 The average monthly flight activity for Brussels Airport and other major airports.

Fig. 2, the average monthly trend figure also presents strong seasonality at Brussels Airport, with a gradual increase from January to July, peaking in the summer, and a subsequent decline toward December.

These 2 figures confirm that there are clear correlations between monthly flight activity and seasonal trends were observed across airports.

## **Methodology**

#### **Overview of Analysis**

This analysis provides seasonal trends and monthly flight activity at Brussels Airport compared to other major Belgian Airports for year (2016-2019). It includes exploratory data analysis, statistical tests and modeling to check differences in flight activity among the airports.

#### **Seasonal Analysis**

-              Goal: To find Seasonal trends in flight activity at Brussels Airport and compare them with other airports.

-              Steps:

1.     Combining the monthly data (like grouping departures, arrivals and total flights) for all years to show seasonal patterns.

2.     Calculating monthly averages for Brussels and other airports.

3.     Line Plots showing trends with peak in summer ad dips in winter.

This helps us to understand the travel trends and plan for busy or slow times.

#### **Total number monthly flight departures and arrivals at Brussels Airport**

-              Goal: To Compare monthly flight activity at Brussels Airport with other major airports.

-              Steps:

1.     Combining the monthly data (like grouping departures, arrivals and total flights) for all years to show seasonal patterns.

2.     Comparing Brussels data with average monthly activity of other airports.

3.     Creating a bar and line plot to highlight difference in flight activity.

This plot shows how Brussels dominate flight compared other airports compare for many consecutive years.

#### **Hypothesis Testing**

-              Goal: To Test if there are significant differences in flight activity distributions among Belgian airports.

-              Steps:

1.     Creating a table containing summarized flight activity by airport and month.

2.     Calculating the expected frequencies by assuming flight activity which is evenly distributed among the airports based in marginal totals in the contingency table.

3.     This test compared observed values with expected values using the formula.

4.     The test statistic and corresponding p-value were used to determine whether observed differences were statistically significant.

5.     Creating bar plot to compare the observed and expected frequencies for each airport making deviations clear.

This Test validates the differences in flight activity distribution among airports are due to random chance or reflect meaningful patterns.

## Results

### A. How does the total number of monthly flight departures and arrivals at Brussels Airport compare to other major airports in Belgium?

By aggregating the data by the variables `YEAR_MONTH` and `APT_NAME`, we were able to get all the total number of flights for departure, arrivals, and totals for each month by year for each airport. We then segregated the Brussels airport data from the rest of the other Belgium airports into two different sets for comparison. For the comparison, we performed a grouping by `YEAR_MONTH` for each of the sets which gave us a sum of the flights across each month for each year for Brussels and all other airports, respectively. When we place this data on a line graph to represent time, we get Figure 1. This graph highlights a few key aspects: 1) Brussels is the most popular airport by number of flights in Belgium with more than double the number of flights per month (with exception to April of 2016 - see Discussion for more information). 2) There appears to be seasonal patterns across the years of 2016 to 2019 for both Brussels airport as well as the rest of Belgium airports, where the peak season appear to be summer time and the lowest number of flights during winter.

### B. What are the seasonal trends over the year?

To evaluate the seasonal trend, we decided to view the trend over the months of a year and aggregating the years from 2016 to 2019 using the variable `MONTH_NUM`. This allows us to look at the data with a perspective that is more general in terms of months across these years. When we plotted this data onto a line plot (Figure 2), we have a more specific trend that shows the busy season of the summer and fall months that lasts from May to September. The number of flights decrease as winter/spring season begins from October until April.
