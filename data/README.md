# Data
-   **[Flights]**: This data comes from Eurocontrol, an international organization for air traffic control management throughout Europe. Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) collects information on daily flights arriving and departing European airports. This data contains 14 columns and 688099 rows for flights from the years of 2017 to 2022. The columns contain information such as the date of the flight, airport designator, airport name, country of the airport, and the numbers of departures and arrivals to the airport. Our focus will be on Belgian airports and our main objective is to explore flight patterns, trends, and relationships across different airports in Belgium. There are no ethical concerns towards the use and analysis of this data.
