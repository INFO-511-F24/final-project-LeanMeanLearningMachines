    "text": "Research Question\nThis dataset, provided by Ankul Sharma on Kaggle (link), was last updated on October 15, 2024. It contains data on Netflix movies and TV shows with 12 columns: show_id, type, title, director, cast, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, and description, while there are some missing values in the columns director, cast, and country.\nThe research question for this dataset is: “How do the country of origin, type of content (Movie or TV Show), and rating influence the release year of Netflix shows?” This original question aims to examine the relationships between these variables, focusing on the target population: all Netflix movies and TV shows available globally within the years included in the dataset. The analysis will involve the variables type, country, release_year, and rating, which include both categorical and quantitative data types.\nThis question is significant because understanding these relationships offers insights into Netflix’s evolving content strategy, regional preferences, and content type trends over time. Additionally, it provides a view into how Netflix ratings might be associated with certain types of content and regional production patterns, highlighting trends that could inform future content decisions.\n\nResearch Topic & Hypotheses\nResearch Topic:\nAnalyzing the characteristics and trends in Netflix content based on country, type, and rating across different years.\nHypotheses:\n- H1: Netflix movies and TV shows from different countries show variation in their release years. - H2: The type of content (Movie vs. TV Show) has a significant influence on the rating it receives. - H3: Higher-rated content is more recent compared to lower-rated content. - H4: The length of Netflix movies and TV shows a positive relationship with its rating.\nVariables: - Categorical Variables: Country, Type, Rating - Quantitative Variable: Release Year"

This information can be useful for manufacturers to promote competition and production of better and more reliable products within this industry. It can also be useful to consumers so they can build more of an understanding for the most reliable vehicle and vehicle products that they can purchase from.\nPotential research questions based on the data set:\n\nOver the past 10 years, what is the trend of number of recalls? Overall? Over select manufacturers? Over component type?\n\nFor overall number of recalls, our hypothesis is that number of overall recalls have decreased\nFor select manufacturers, we can select a few manufacturers to hone in on (maybe based on other data indicating high/low number of vehicle sales), and compare number of recalls. Our hypothesis is that the proportion of sales to recalls are congruent between high/low number of vehicle sales over the past 10 years.\nFor component type, we can select certain components such as components specifically designed for passenger safety and hypothesize that recalls had decreased over the past 10 years\nWhat’s involved: These research questions will involve quantitative data like number of recalls, number of potentially affected vehicles. It will also include categorical data such as manufacturers and component types. It will also deal with periodical data.\n\nWhat products tend to be up for recalls?\n\nOur hypothesis is that throughout the past 10 or more years, there have been more electrical recalls due to increase in hybrid vehicles.\nWhat’s involved: This research question will deal with quantitative data such as number of recalls. It will also have categorical data such as recall types and component types.\n\nUpon the recalls, what is the percent of completion rate?\n\nOur hypothesis is that over the years, the completion rate overall has been increasing\nWhat’s involved: This research question will deal with quantitative data such as completion rates, number of recalls. It will also deal with periodical data."

    "text": "Analysis plan\nRelative to the research questions stated above, here are the analysis plans for each of the questions:\n\n1i) The variables involved would be number of recalls, number of vehicles potentially affected, and the dates of the report by year. We can make various analysis on this over a periodical graph indicating the trend of these numbers overtime.\n1ii) The variables involved would be the number of recalls, number of vehicles potentially affected, the categorical data of component type, possibly the categorical data of recall type, and the dates of the report by year. We can also make a periodoical graph indicating trends overtime, and then group by and discuss about a select recall/component type.\n1iii) The variables involved would be the number of recalls, number of vehicles potentially affected, the categorical manufacturer data, the categorical data of component type, possibly the categorical data of recall type, and the dates of the report by year. With this, we can make a periodical graph differentiating the trends over year by manufacturer and broken down further into component and recall type.\n2i) The variables involved would be the number of recalls and the categorical data of recall type, component type, and the date of the report. We can test this hypothesis by comparing the number of recalls of electrical recalls over time\n3i) The variables involved would be the completion rate, number of recalls, and the date of the report. We can test his hypothesis by mapping out trends in the completion rate over a period of time and seeing if there is a strong pattern amongst the trend."
