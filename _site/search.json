    "text": "Research Question\nThis dataset, provided by Ankul Sharma on Kaggle (link), was last updated on October 15, 2024. It contains data on Netflix movies and TV shows with 12 columns: show_id, type, title, director, cast, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, and description, while there are some missing values in the columns director, cast, and country.\nThe research question for this dataset is: “How do the country of origin, type of content (Movie or TV Show), and rating influence the release year of Netflix shows?” This original question aims to examine the relationships between these variables, focusing on the target population: all Netflix movies and TV shows available globally within the years included in the dataset. The analysis will involve the variables type, country, release_year, and rating, which include both categorical and quantitative data types.\nThis question is significant because understanding these relationships offers insights into Netflix’s evolving content strategy, regional preferences, and content type trends over time. Additionally, it provides a view into how Netflix ratings might be associated with certain types of content and regional production patterns, highlighting trends that could inform future content decisions.\n\nResearch Topic & Hypotheses\nResearch Topic:\nAnalyzing the characteristics and trends in Netflix content based on country, type, and rating across different years.\nHypotheses:\n- H1: Netflix movies and TV shows from different countries show variation in their release years. - H2: The type of content (Movie vs. TV Show) has a significant influence on the rating it receives. - H3: Higher-rated content is more recent compared to lower-rated content. - H4: The length of Netflix movies and TV shows a positive relationship with its rating.\nVariables: - Categorical Variables: Country, Type, Rating - Quantitative Variable: Release Year"
