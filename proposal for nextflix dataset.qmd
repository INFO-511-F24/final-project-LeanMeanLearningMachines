## Research Question

This dataset, provided by Ankul Sharma on Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankulsharma150/netflix-data-analysis/data)), was last updated on October 15, 2024. It contains data on Netflix movies and TV shows with 12 columns: `show_id`, `type`, `title`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `listed_in`, and `description`, while there are some missing values in the columns `director`, `cast`, and `country`.

The research question for this dataset is: **"How do the country of origin, type of content (Movie or TV Show), and rating influence the release year of Netflix shows?"** This original question aims to examine the relationships between these variables, focusing on the **target population**: all Netflix movies and TV shows available globally within the years included in the dataset. The analysis will involve the variables `type`, `country`, `release_year`, and `rating`, which include both categorical and quantitative data types.

This question is significant because understanding these relationships offers insights into Netflixâ€™s evolving content strategy, regional preferences, and content type trends over time. Additionally, it provides a view into how Netflix ratings might be associated with certain types of content and regional production patterns, highlighting trends that could inform future content decisions.

### Research Topic & Hypotheses

**Research Topic:**\
Analyzing the characteristics and trends in Netflix content based on country, type, and rating across different years.

**Hypotheses:**\
- H1: Netflix movies and TV shows from different countries show variation in their release years. - H2: The type of content (Movie vs. TV Show) has a significant influence on the rating it receives. - H3: Higher-rated content is more recent compared to lower-rated content. - H4: The length of Netflix movies and TV shows a positive relationship with its rating.

**Variables:** - **Categorical Variables:** Country, Type, Rating - **Quantitative Variable:** Release Year

## Glimpse of data

The dataset contains 12 columns, with the following relevant columns for our research question: - `country`: Country where the content was produced. - `type`: Whether the content is a Movie or TV Show. - `rating`: Content rating (e.g., PG-13, TV-MA). - `release_year`: Year when the content was released.

```{python}
#| label: Glimpse of the data

Netflix_dt.head()
Netflix_dt.info()
```

## Analysis plan

1.  **Data Exploration:**\
    Use `.head()` and `.info()` functions for an initial exploration of the dataset to confirm data quality and presence of null values.

2.  **Variable Preprocessing:**

    -   Filter out missing values in the `country` and `rating` columns.
    -   Convert `release_year` into a numeric format if necessary for consistency.

3.  **Statistical Analysis:**

    -   Perform comparative analysis by country and type to identify trends in release years.
    -   Analyze rating distribution across different types and countries to detect patterns.

4.  **Hypothesis Testing:**

    -   Use appropriate statistical tests to validate the hypotheses above.
